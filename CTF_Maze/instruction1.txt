Welcome to the ITC CTF, Maze of Obfuscation.

	Try to navigate your way through the logs and find the corresponding keys/encrypted messages 
	and files that are needed to advance! 
	
	You may need to use ideas from the Linux, Encryption/Decryption and other units! 
	Category: Linux, Encryption, Steg, Other.

	Note:
	You may want to copy paste this folder into WSL or use some similar Linux associated structure before beginning.

	Good Luck!
